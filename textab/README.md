**Textab is a Cursor alternative.**

Use AI agents on your codebase, checkpoint and visualize changes, and bring any model or host locally. Textab sends messages directly to providers without retaining your data.

## What is Textab?

Textab is a powerful code editor built on top of VS Code that integrates AI capabilities directly into your development workflow. Unlike other AI-powered editors, Textab:

- **Preserves your privacy** - Messages go directly to AI providers without being stored
- **Works with any model** - Bring your own AI model or host it locally
- **Visualizes changes** - See and checkpoint your code modifications
- **Runs AI agents** - Let AI work on your entire codebase, not just individual files
